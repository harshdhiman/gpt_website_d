# GPT-3 Website (React & SCSS) (All TS)

Live at https://gpt-website-d.netlify.app/

This is a simple Website made using React and SCSS only. I wanted to not use TailwindCSS this time and go for SCSS (used mixins, includes, scss conditions etc.)

also have lazy loaded components (code splitting)
also tried to use BEM CSS Naming conventions.
